Music For Estranged Speakers is a sound compilation that decouples the stereo field. The artists worked with the constraint that the speakers must be treated as separate entities and that the sounds must be hard-panned (i.e. located on either the L or R speakers). Listening through speakers is recommended.

All profits go to Klik, a charity that helps people with housing and social problems in Berlin.
